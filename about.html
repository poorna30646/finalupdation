      <h2>🎣 What is Phishing?</h2>
      <p>
        Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers create fake
        websites or messages that look like legitimate ones in order to
        steal sensitive information such as usernames, passwords,
        banking details, and personal data.

        behavioral signals to determine whether a website is safe or
        potentially dangerous.
